The Chart Best Practices Guide
------------------------------

This guide covers the Helm Teamâ€™s considered best practices for creating
charts. It focuses on how charts should be structured.

We focus primarily on best practices for charts that may be publicly
deployed. We know that many charts are for internal-use only, and
authors of such charts may find that their internal interests override
our suggestions here.
