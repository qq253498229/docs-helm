<h1 id="the-kubernetes-helm-architecture">The Kubernetes Helm Architecture</h1>
<p>This document describes the Helm architecture at a high level.</p>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-helm">The Purpose of Helm</h2>
<p>Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes packages called <em>charts</em>. Helm can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create new charts from scratch</li>
<li>Package charts into chart archive (tgz) files</li>
<li>Interact with chart repositories where charts are stored</li>
<li>Install and uninstall charts into an existing Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>Manage the release cycle of charts that have been installed with Helm</li>
</ul>
<p>For Helm, there are three important concepts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <em>chart</em> is a bundle of information necessary to create an instance of a Kubernetes application.</li>
<li>The <em>config</em> contains configuration information that can be merged into a packaged chart to create a releasable object.</li>
<li>A <em>release</em> is a running instance of a <em>chart</em>, combined with a specific <em>config</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>Helm has two major components:</p>
<p><strong>The Helm Client</strong> is a command-line client for end users. The client is responsible for the following domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local chart development</li>
<li>Managing repositories</li>
<li>Interacting with the Tiller server
<ul>
<li>Sending charts to be installed</li>
<li>Asking for information about releases</li>
<li>Requesting upgrading or uninstalling of existing releases</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Tiller Server</strong> is an in-cluster server that interacts with the Helm client, and interfaces with the Kubernetes API server. The server is responsible for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening for incoming requests from the Helm client</li>
<li>Combining a chart and configuration to build a release</li>
<li>Installing charts into Kubernetes, and then tracking the subsequent release</li>
<li>Upgrading and uninstalling charts by interacting with Kubernetes</li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, the client is responsible for managing charts, and the server is responsible for managing releases.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The Helm client is written in the Go programming language, and uses the gRPC protocol suite to interact with the Tiller server.</p>
<p>The Tiller server is also written in Go. It provides a gRPC server to connect with the client, and it uses the Kubernetes client library to communicate with Kubernetes. Currently, that library uses REST+JSON.</p>
<p>The Tiller server stores information in ConfigMaps located inside of Kubernetes. It does not need its own database.</p>
<p>Configuration files are, when possible, written in YAML.</p>
