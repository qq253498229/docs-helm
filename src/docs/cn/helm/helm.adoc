== helm

The Helm package manager for Kubernetes.

=== Synopsis

The Kubernetes package manager

To begin working with Helm, run the 'helm init' command:

[source]
----
$ helm init
----

This will install Tiller to your running Kubernetes cluster.
It will also set up any necessary local configuration.

Common actions from this point include:

* helm search: search for charts
* helm fetch: download a chart to your local directory to view
* helm install: upload the chart to Kubernetes
* helm list: list releases of charts

Environment:
 $HELM_HOME set an alternative location for Helm files. By default, these are stored in ~/.helm
 $HELM_HOST set an alternative Tiller host. The format is host:port
 $HELM_NO_PLUGINS disable plugins. Set HELM_NO_PLUGINS=1 to disable plugins.
 $TILLER_NAMESPACE set an alternative Tiller namespace (default "kube-system")
 $KUBECONFIG set an alternative Kubernetes configuration file (default "~/.kube/config")
